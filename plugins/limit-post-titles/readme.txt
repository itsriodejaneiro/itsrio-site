Limit post titles (including pages and custom post types) within the WordPress dashboard.

== Description ==

Limit post titles with a character limit within the WordPress dashboard. The plugin works with default post types (posts/pages) as well as any custom post types defined by plugins or themes.

Simply set the character limit in the plugin's settings pane and check which post types you wish to limit.

The title is limited within the dashboard only and pre-existing titles may need to be updated to match the new limit.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin in the WordPress dashboard
3. Tweak the settings under 'Settings -> Limit Post Titles'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work with custom post types? =

= My post titles don't seem to be limitedâ€¦ =

The plugin only limits within the dashboard. Posts added before the plugin was activated will need to be modified to match the newly imposed limit.
