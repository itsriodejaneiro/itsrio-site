### Live Examples

* You can choose to setup our GDPR plugin in any way that you like. 
* We have created the plugin with as much flexibility as possible as organisations interpret the Cookie Law and Cookie Consent Policy differently.
* A few examples of how you can setup our plugin in various ways are below:

**OPTION A** 
No cookies are stored on users' computers until the user accepts cookies: 
[Example 1](https://www.mooveagency.com/wordpress-plugins/gdpr-cookie-compliance/)

**OPTION B**  
The 'Full-Screen Cookie Wall' option is used, cookies are accepted by default but the user has the option to turn them off: 
[Example 2](https://www.teneo.net/uk/)

**OPTION C** 
Cookies are accepted by default but the user has the option to turn them off: 
[Example 3](https://www.nacro.org.uk/)

**OPTION D**  
Cookie Consent Banner is displayed at the top of the page. Cookies are also accepted automatically just by scrolling down the page:
[Example 4](https://www.mrisoftware.com/uk/)

There are many other settings available that you can use to create your own unique Cookie Consent Banner and satisfy the Cookie Compliance Law - our plugin is very flexible. 

### Custom Layout

* You can also create your own custom front-end layout.
* Simply copy the "gdpr-modules" folder from the plugin directory to your theme directory. 
* If you do this, your changes will be retained even if you update the plugin in future. 
* Any customisation should be implemented by experienced developers only.
