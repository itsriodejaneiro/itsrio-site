Facebook Pixel Management Made Easy. Set Up Facebook Pixel Events, Track Conversions & Build Custom Audiences With This Facebook Pixel WordPress Plugin.

== Description ==

= Facebook Pixel Management Made Easy =
Pixel Cat - Facebook Pixel Manager lets you add a Facebook Pixel to your site in a matter of minutes.

Confused by Facebook's pixel code? Wary of pasting a script into your theme?

Pixel Cat is a lean, simple plugin that avoids unnecessary bloat and does one thing well: letting you add the new Facebook pixel to your site with ease.

= Which features does Pixel Cat have? =
* Add the new Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site with ease.
* Hide your Facebook Pixel from logged-in users so you don't pollute your data.
* Create Facebook Pixel Events using our Event Builder.

= Why use Pixel Cat - Facebook Pixel Manager? =

There are multiple ways to add a Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site.

**1. Pasting your Facebook Pixel into your theme**
This approach isn't great for two reasons:
a) If you edit your live site and make a mistake when pasting your Facebook Pixel script into your theme, you could take down your website.
b) If your theme is updated with new features or security fixes, your Facebook Pixel code will be overwritten.

**2. Pasting the new Facebook Pixel script into a header/footer script plugin**
This is a valid approach, but has some disadvantages. General purposes "header script plugins" aren't built from the ground-up to support Facebook's Pixel. 

What this means is that :
a) These plugins lack Facebook-specific functionality.
b) These plugins will not adapt if Facebook changes their pixel again in the future. Since Pixel Cat is a dedicated Facebook Pixel Manager, we'll make sure make sure to stay compatible with future changes by Facebook.
c) These plugins usually don't support hiding your Facebook Pixel from logged-in users.


The bottom line is that Pixel Cat is the best way to add a Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site.

= Does Pixel Cat - Facebook Pixel Manager support the new Facebook Pixel? =
Yes. Pixel Cat is built from the ground up to support the new Facebook Pixel.

Pixel Cat does not work with the old "Facebook Conversion Pixel" that Facebook deprecated in 2016.

= Can I hide my Facebook Pixel form logged in users? =
Yes. You can hide your Facebook Pixels from logged in users by going to Settings -> Facebook Pixel Manager.

= Is Pixel Cat - Facebook Pixel Manager easy to translate? =
Yes. Pixel Cat - Facebook Pixel Cat is fully translateable. Please let us know if you're interested in contributing.
