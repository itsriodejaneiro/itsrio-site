Dynamically adds multiple featured image (post thumbnail) functionality to posts, pages and custom post types.

== Description ==

Dynamically adds multiple featured image or multiple post thumbnail functionality to your page, posts and custom post types. This plugin provides you an interface to add any number of featured image as you want without writing a single line of code. These featured images can then be collected by the various theme functions.

**Overview**  

Dynamic Featured Image enables the option to have MULTIPLE featured images within a post or page. 
This is especially helpful when you use other plugins, post thumbnails or sliders that use featured images. 
Why limit yourself to only one featured image if you can do some awesome stuffs with multiple featured image? 
DFI allows you to add different number of featured images to each post and page that can be collected by the various theme functions.

> **A NOTE ABOUT SUPPORT:** Weâ€™re here to help troubleshoot bugs, but please don't set expectations early as the support forums at WordPress.org are only checked once in a while.

**How it works?**  
1. After successfull plugin activation go to `add` or `edit` page of posts or pages and you will notice a box for second featured image.  
2. Click `Set featured image`, select required image from "Dynamic Featured Image - Media Selector" popup and click `Set Featured Image`.  
3. Click on `Add New` to add new featured image or use `Remove` link to remove the featured image box.  
4. You can then get the images by calling the function `$dynamic_featured_image->get_featured_images([$postId (optional)])` in your theme. ([Click here for details](https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/Dynamic-Featured-Image/wiki "Documentation for current version"))  
5. The data will be returned in the following format.
`

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the `dynamic-featured-images` directory to the plugin directory (`/wp-content/plugins/`) or install it from `Plugins->Add New->Upload`.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. If you don't see new featured image box, click `Screen Options` in the upper right corner of your wordpress admin and make sure that the `Featured Image 2` box is selected.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= 1. The media uploader screen freezes and stays blank after clicking insert into post? =
The problem is usually due to the conflicts with other plugin or theme functions. You can use general debugging technique to find out the problem.

i. Switch to the default wordpress theme to rule out any theme-specific problems.  
ii. Try the plugin in a fresh new WordPress installation.  
iii. If it works, deactivate all plugins from your current wordpress installation to see if this resolves the problem. If this works, re-activate the plugins one by one until you find the problematic plugin(s).  
iv. [Resetting the plugins folder](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Troubleshooting#How_to_deactivate_all_plugins_when_not_able_to_access_the_administrative_menus.3F) by FTP or PhpMyAdmin. Sometimes, an apparently inactive plugin can still cause problems.

= 2. There is no additional image on the page when I save it or publish it? =
This happens when there is any problem in saving you post or page properly. For example, if you try to save or publish the post without the post title the featured images may not be saved properly.

= 3. Can I set the image from remote url? =
If you need to add images from the remote url you need to switch back to ver. 2.0.2 . There is no such feature in ver. 3.0.0 and above.

Note: If you are using remote url to use the feature image, the helper functions may not work properly. 
Alt, caption and title attribute for these images cannot be retrieved using helper functions. `NULL` is returned instead.

= 4. I cannot add or change secondary featured images after update? =
This usually happens because of cache. Clear all your cache and try again if you are having this problem. If you still have such problem you can get help through support forum.

= 5. Is it possible to make DFI work only for certain post types? =
Yes! It is easily possible from version 3.1.13. A filter is added in the recent version for this purpose. Refer [this thread](https://ankitpokhrel.com/explore/is-it-possible-to-make-dfi-work-only-for-certain-post-types/) for mor info.
